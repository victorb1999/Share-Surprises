# Share-Surprises
The application "Share surprises" categorizes surprises into three categories: "GiveSurpriseAndApplause," "GiveSurpriseAndSing," and "GiveSurpriseAndHug." with the help of inheritance, composition, and aggregation. Encapsulation hides functionalities and data, while interfaces are used to communicate between components.
